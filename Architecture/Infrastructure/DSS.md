# Metadata Services for Cancer Data (DSS)

NCI fosters the shared metadata standards for all cancer data that link together semantic meaning and data value. These standards promote sharing, re-use, and aggregation of cancer data among repositories. The Data Standards Service (DSS) team will provide harmonization of CRDC data elements identified by the representatives across the CRDC and establish a process for community suggestion, prioritization, and review of new CRDC data elements for harmonization. The standards promoted by DSS will ensure that multi-modal cancer research data can be combined, analyzed, and turned into knowledge that's useful to the broader research community.
