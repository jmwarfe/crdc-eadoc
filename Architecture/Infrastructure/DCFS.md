# NCI Data Commons Framework Services

NCI Data Commons Framework Services (DCFS) are an instance of Gen3 operated by the University of Chicago's Center for Translational Data Science. DCFS collaborates and connects with all parts of the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) to enhance opportunities for cancer research with the services mentioned below. DCF provides Data Repository Service (DRS), AuthN/AuthZ, and search APIs of cloud storage for the CRDC. The DCF is based on the narrow middle architecture for a data commons.

This architecture requires standardizing very few core services that are essential for the system functioning and making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). Other services are not standardized and therefore different approaches could be used depending on the goals, costs, and functionality.
