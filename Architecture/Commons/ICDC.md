# Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC)

The Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC) was established to further research on human cancers by enabling comparative analysis with canine cancer. Canines have many genes similar to human genes, which are involved in cancers in similar ways. They develop spontaneous diseases and respond to treatments like humans, live in a family environment shared with humans, and like humans receive health care and participate in clinical trials. Canines are also of scientific interest because of their accelerated aging process.
