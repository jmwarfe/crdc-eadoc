# Proteomic Data Commons (PDC)

The Proteomic Data Commons (PDC) was developed to advance understanding of how proteins help to shape the risk, diagnosis, development, progression, and treatment of cancer. In-depth analysis of proteomic data allows the study of both how and why cancer develops and informs ways of tailoring treatment for individual patients using precision medicine.
